# PreVo
## Introduction
PreVo is a voice-driven presentation Application for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). The main concept is that the app provides you 
with tools to easily design and execute sophisticated presenations that are entirely driven by voice gestures.

This project started as part of the Microsoft event Night of the Living Devs 2015, where teams of up to 5 students all over Europe had 
24 hours to design, build and present a prototype of their UWP Application idea. Our team (which in a single moment of combined brilliance 
and mental retardation was baptized *MLGApps*) came up with this application idea, and after a long and eventful night of brainstorming, 
UI design, endless consumption of energy drinks, vigorous coding, multiple searches for local cocaine suppliers, awkward programmer 
gestures, and tons of support from the fabulous technical mentors and specialists at the Microsoft Greece HQ, finally achieved 1st place
in the National and 2nd place in the European placements. We are really proud for what we did, and so are our grandmas and imaginary girlfriends.
